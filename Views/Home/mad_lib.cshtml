      <h1>Here is your lib</h1>
      <p>One day, @Model.GetName() went to the store @Model.GetAdverb() to get some @Model.GetNouns(). Unfortunately before that person got there a car came out of nowhere and hit their @Model.GetVehicle(). @Model.GetName() got out of the @Model.GetVehicle() and said many bad words at the other driver. But it wasn't a person driving the car at all - it was a @Model.GetAnimal(). Now they're best @Model.GetNouns2().</p>
